# ToDoList

This ToDo list was created as a school assignment on 15-08-2023. It was developed early in my education, but it shouldn't contain any bugs.

## Project Description

The assignment was simple: create a ToDo list where users can add and delete tasks. I decided to add a "complete" feature as well, allowing users to mark tasks as finished before choosing to delete them. I found this helpful for keeping track of completed tasks and then deleting them once everything was done.
